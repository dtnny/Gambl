## Synopsis

The Gambling Awareness App is a full-stack web application designed to simplify the process of tracking gambling activities for tax purposes. Built with **Next.js** for the frontend, **Supabase** for authentication and data storage, it allows users to log gambling wins and losses, generate tax reports, and manage their accounts securely. The application provides an intuitive interface for users to claim deductions by documenting their gambling sessions accurately, ensuring compliance with tax regulations.

## Motivation

This project was developed to address the complexity of tracking gambling-related financial data for tax filings. Many individuals struggle to maintain accurate records of their gambling wins and losses, which can lead to missed deductions or tax inaccuracies. The Gambling Awareness App aims to empower users with a user-friendly tool to manage their gambling activities responsibly, making tax season less stressful and helping them maximize legitimate deductions.

- **Gambling Diary**: Log gambling sessions, including wins, losses, and supporting documents (planned feature).
- **Tax Report Generation**: Create organized reports for tax deductions (stubbed feature).
- **Dashboard**: Personalized hub with quick access to key actions like filing losses or checking rewards.
- **Responsive UI**: Clean interface built with Tailwind CSS, optimized for desktop. Has persistent navigation with an account dropdown for signed-in users.
- **Secure Data Handling**: Uses Supabaseâ€™s encryption for user data and complies with privacy standards.
